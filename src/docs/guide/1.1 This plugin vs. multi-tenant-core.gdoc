Those of you who has been using the multi-tenant plugin for a while are probably using multi-tenant-core. 
This great plugin was unmaintained for a long time and suffered from a list of minor and major problems. 
The plugin made use of some classes from the unofficial @sun.*@ package, had compatibility problems with recent 
versions of Grails and used some intrusive means in order to intercepting Hibernate Sessions and criteria. 
Another problem was that webflow support added a compile-time dependency to the webflow plugin. 
This caused web flow support to be dropped from the multi-tenant-core plugin. 

At some point Scott Ryan took over maintenance of the plugin. 
A few months later the multi-tenant organization was formed on GitHub by a group of developers invested in the plugin.
The organization was formed to drive the plugin development forward. The most serious problems mentioned above has been fixed
in the current version of multi-tenant-core. 

Kim A. Betti started working on webflow support without compile time dependency and a less intrusive way of intercepting Hibernate sessions.
The result of this work was this plugin (multi-tenant-single-db). The original plan was to merge at least some of the solutions in this plugin back into 
[multi-tenant-core|http://github.com/multi-tenant/grails-multi-tenant-core], but the plugins has drifted further apart while refactoring and 
improving single-database mode. 

# Merging the changes back into multi-tenant-core would introduce unnecessary dependencies (Hawk Eventing and Hibernate Hijacker) for those using the plugin in multi-database mode.
# Some of the changes in this plugin would break existing applications. 
# Align the plugin more closely with the most common use cases.
