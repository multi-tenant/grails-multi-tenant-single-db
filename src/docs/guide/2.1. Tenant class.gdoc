Most applications will have a domain class where you store tenant data. This will probably be named something like @User@, @Customer@ or @Tenant@.
By implementing the interface @grails.plugin.multitenant.core.Tenant@ and overriding the @Integer tenantId()@ method,
the plugin will give you some benefits out of the box.  

The examples below assumes that you have a tenant class similar to this.

{code:java}
import grails.plugin.multitenant.core.Tenant

class Customer implements Tenant {

    String name

    Integer tenantId() {
        return this.id
    }

}
{code}

h3. Automatic tenant events

The plugin will trigger a few custom events when changes are made to your tenant domain class. 
This can be very useful for things like maintaining a cache for fast lookups. 

The following events are published when a tenant has been added, updated or deleted: @tenant.created@, @tenant.updated@ and @tenant.deleted@.

{code:java}
class MyTenantService implements InitializingBean { 

    def eventBroker

    void afterPropertiesSet() {
        eventBroker.subscribe("tenant.createed") { evt ->
            println "New tenant created: " + evt.payload
        }    
    }

}
{code}

Have a look at the [documentation for Hawk Eventing|http://multi-tenant.github.com/grails-hawk-eventing/] for information on how to subscribe to these events.

h4. Dynamic methods

The plugin adds a few methods to your @Tenant@ class. 

h5. withThisTenant

Normally you want as much as possible of the multi-tenant stuff to happen transparently behind the scenes, but there are cases where it's useful to be able to run operations on a specific tenant. This is often useful during testing and bootstrapping of the application during development. 

{code:java}
def customerX = new Customer(name: "Customer X")
customerX.save()

customerX.withThisTenant {
    // All Hibernate related operations executed here
    // will happen with 'Customer X' as current tenant. 
}
{code}

h5. withTenantId

This is method is similar to @withThisTenant@, but is added to the static meta class. 
It's useful when you don't have the tenant instance available, but you know the tenant-id. 

{code:java}
Customer.withTenantId(123) {
    // All Hibernate related operations executed here
    // will be executed with tenant id 123. 
}
{code}

This method is added to the Tenant interface either, so, whatever you Tenant class is named (@Customer@, @User@, etc), you can always use:

{code:java}
Tenant.withTenantId(123) {
    // All Hibernate related operations executed here
    // will be executed with tenant id 123. 
}
{code}

h5. withoutTenantRestriction

This method does the opposite of others. The plugin executes the closure passed as parameter without any tenant restrictions.
For example, if you're running on tenant 1, and run the following code:

{code:java}
def messages = []

Customer.withoutTenantRestriction {
    // All Hibernate related operations executed here
    // will be executed without any tenant restriction.
    messages = Message.list()
}
{code}                     

It will return all messages in the database, even @Message@ being a @\@MultiTenant@ annotated class.

This method, as @withTenantId@, is added to the Tenant interface, so, whatever you can use:

{code:java}
Customer.withoutTenantRestriction {
    // All Hibernate related operations executed here
    // will be executed without any tenant restriction.
}
{code}
